## Requirements

I made this application using Python 3.14.0 in Windows 10 using CMD console and VSCode. I also use the Microsoft Black Formatter extension in VSCode.

## Install

- Clone this repo and go into the cloned folder
- Create the virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`
- Activate it:
  - `.venv\Scripts\activate` in CMD
  - or select the `Python: select Interpreter` option in VSCode, kill terminal if it's opened and open it again.
- Install dependencies `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Execute `run.sh` or `python main.py`

## Unit tests

- Activate the virtual environment (see Install section)
- Execute `pytest`
